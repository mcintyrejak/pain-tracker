# pain-tracker

A simple app for people who want to track their chronic pain.

As a user, I want:

1. To record my pain by date and time, using an easy to understand pain scale
2. To keep track of the location of the pain
3. To visualize my pain over days, weeks, and months
4. To be able to include certain variables for these periods such as medications, diets, and stress events
5. To be able to download this data to my computer to share it with my doctor
